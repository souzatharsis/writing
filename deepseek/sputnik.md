On October 4, 1957, the USSR launched a 184 pound satellite into orbit: Sputnik.

The satellite didn’t do anything — it just “beeped” (over radio waves). But it was an alarm clock for the USA.

Shortly after Sputnik 1 (and Sputnik 2 in November 1957), the US attempted to respond with the Navy’s Project Vanguard on December 6, 1957, which exploded 2 seconds after liftoff. 

Almost immediately, Eisenhower greenlit the Army’s Jupiter-C/Explorer program under Wernher von Braun, which launched Explorer 1 — America’s first successful orbiting satellite — in January of 1958.

Shortly thereafter was a flurry of activity:
Congress and Eisenhower established NASA in 1958, consolidating military and civilian efforts into a unified agency. NASA’s funding grew 60x from 1958-1964.

Congress passed the National Defense Education Act that same year, channeling $1B into STEM education, and marking a cultural shift, encouraging young Americans to pursue careers in engineering.

ARPA (now DARPA) was created in February, 1958 (the Internet comes from ARPANET!).

America went from laggard in the space race to unified, fast-moving behemoth. By 1969, we had landed men on the moon, a feat the Soviets never accomplished. Sputnik didn’t just wake us up to pursue and *win* the space race, but arguably renewed America’s commitment to scientific leadership and engineering prowess, laying the groundwork for America’s role as a global technology leader in the decades to come.
