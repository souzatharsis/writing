Format constraints are essential for system integration and data exchange.\nMultiple Choice Constraints: Restricting LLM outputs to a predefined set of options helps ensure valid responses and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or invalid outputs. This is particularly useful for classification tasks or when specific categorical responses are required.\nStatic Typing Constraints: Enforcing data type requirements (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) ensures outputs can be safely processed by downstream systems. Type constraints help prevent runtime errors and improve system reliability.\nLength Constraints: Limiting the length of generated content is crucial for UI display, platform requirements (like Twitter’s character limit), and maintaining consistent user experience. Length constraints can be applied at the character, word, or token level.\nEnsuring Output Consistency: Consistent output length and format are crucial for user experience and UI clarity. Constraints help maintain this consistency, avoiding overwhelming variability in generated text."
