## Testing Complexity

LLMs are Generative, Non-Deterministic, and have Emergent Properties.

![LLMs "Emerging Properties" Phenomenon. From: "Pathways Language Model (PaLM): Scaling to 540 Billion Parameters for Breakthrough Performance"](images/emergent-properties-palm.gif){width="100%"}



## Testing Complexity {.smaller}

| Aspect | Traditional Software Products | LLM-Based Software Products |
|:--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Capability Assessment | Validates specific functionality against requirements | May assess emergent properties like reasoning and creativity |
| Metrics and Measurement | Precisely defined and measurable metrics | Subjective qualities that resist straightforward quantification |
| Dataset Contamination | Uses carefully crafted test cases | Risk of memorized evaluation examples from training |
| Benchmark Evolution | Maintains stable test suites | Continuously evolving benchmarks as capabilities advance |
| Human Evaluation | Mostly automated validation | May require significant human oversight |

**Takeaways**

::: incremental
- Testing LLMs requires a fundamental mindset shift from deterministic to probabilistic evaluation
  - Traditional software testing methods are inadequate for LLM variability
  - Success requires embracing comprehensive evaluation frameworks
  - Evaluation is the new Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Structural (un)Reliability
:::

## Structural (un)Reliability

::: incremental
- Language Models excel at generating human-like text but struggle with producing structured output consistently [@tang2024strucbenchlargelanguagemodels; @shorten2024structuredragjsonresponseformatting]
- This limitation poses significant challenges when integrating LLMs into production systems
  - Databases
  - APIs 
  - Other software applications
- Even carefully crafted prompts cannot guarantee consistent structural adherence in LLM responses
:::

## Structural (un)Reliability {.smaller}

But what user needs drive the demand for LLM output constraints? A recent Google Research [@10.1145/3613905.3650756] study explored this question through a survey of 51 industry professionals who use LLMs in their work:

::: incremental
- **Improving Developer Efficiency and Workflow**
  - Reducing trial and error in prompt engineering
  - Minimizing post-processing of LLM outputs 
  - Streamlining integration with downstream processes
  - Enhancing quality of synthetic datasets

- **Meeting UI and Product Requirements**
  - Adhering to UI size limitations
  - Ensuring output consistency

- **Enhancing User Trust and Experience**
  - Mitigating hallucinations
  - Driving user adoption
:::

<!-- To constrain LLM output is not just a technical consideration but a fundamental user need, impacting developer efficiency and user experience. -->


## Structural (un)Reliability {.smaller}

The text generation process follows a probabilistic approach. At each step, the model calculates the probability distribution over its entire vocabulary to determine the most likely next token:

\begin{equation}
P(X) = P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|x_{<i})
\end{equation}

where, $x_i$ represents the current token being generated, while $x_{<i}$ encompasses all preceding tokens.


![Text Generation Process: "Sampling".](images/logit.svg){#fig-logit}


## Structural (un)Reliability {.smaller}

 This controlled text generation\index{Controlled text generation} process can be formalized as [@liang2024controllabletextgenerationlarge]:

\begin{equation}
P(X|\color{green}{C}) = P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n|\color{green}{C}) = \prod_{i=1}^n p(x_i|x_{<i}, \color{green}{C})
\end{equation}

Here, $\color{green}{C}$ represents the set of constraints or control conditions that shape the generated output.

## Structural (un)Reliability {.smaller}

Common constraints ($C$) include:

::: incremental
- **Format Constraints**: Enforcing specific output formats like JSON, XML, or YAML ensures the generated content follows a well-defined structure that can be easily parsed and validated. Format constraints are essential for system integration and data exchange.

- **Multiple Choice Constraints**: Restricting LLM outputs to a predefined set of options helps ensure valid responses and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or invalid outputs. This is particularly useful for classification tasks or when specific categorical responses are required.

- **Static Typing Constraints**: Enforcing data type requirements (strings, integers, booleans, etc.) ensures outputs can be safely processed by downstream systems. Type constraints help prevent runtime errors and improve system reliability.

- **Length Constraints**: Limiting the length of generated content is crucial for UI display, platform requirements (like Twitter's character limit), and maintaining consistent user experience. Length constraints can be applied at the character, word, or token level.

- **Ensuring Output Consistency**: Consistent output length and format are crucial for user experience and UI clarity. Constraints help maintain this consistency, avoiding overwhelming variability in generated text.

![Impact of Output Constraints in Model Performance [@dottxt2024saywhatyoumean]](images/rebuttal.png){#fig-rebuttal fig-align="center"}

## Structural (un)Reliability: Takeaways {.smaller}

- Prompt engineering and the use of fine-tuned models can help control the output of LLMs.

- However, when strong guarantees are needed, practitioners should consider techniques such as logit post-processing that provides formal guarantees for controlled output generation.

- The impact of output constraints on model performance remains an open research question suggesting the need for evals to guide implementation decisions

## Input Data Issues {.smaller}

::: incremental
- LLMs are sensitive to input formatting and structure, requiring careful data preparation to achieve optimal results [@he2024doespromptformattingimpact; @liu2024enhancingllmscognitionstructurization; @tan2024htmlraghtmlbetterplain].
- LLMs operate with knowledge cutoffs, providing potentially outdated information that may not reflect current reality and demonstrate problems with temporal knowledge accuracy [@amayuelas-etal-2024-knowledge].
- LLMs exhibit drawbacks when processing long context facing "lost-in-the-middle" problems [@wu2024longdocumentsummaryevaluation] and struggle with less common but important information showing a systematic loss of long-tail knowledge [@kotha2024understanding].

```

## Input Data Issues {.smaller}

**RAG Helps Mitigate Hallucination, Lack of Temporal and Domain-Specific Knowledge**

![Simplified RAG Pipeline including a Vector Database with Embeddings and Indexing, a Retrieval System including re-ranking with LLM Augmented Generation via In-Context Learning.](images/rag.png){#fig-rag fig-align="center"}


## Input Data Issues {.smaller}


![Long-Context LLMs demonstrate superior performance while RAGs are more cost-effective [@li2024retrievalaugmentedgenerationlongcontext].](images/LC.png){#fig-LC fig-align="center"}


## Input Data Issues {.smaller}

Do we really need RAGs? The answer is conditional:

::: incremental
- **RAG may be relevant when cost-effectiveness is a key requirement** and where the model needs to access vast amounts of external knowledge without incurring high computational expenses. However, as LLMs context window sizes increase and LLMs cost per input token decreases, RAGs may not be as relevant as it was before.
- **Long-context LLMs are superior when performance is the primary concern**, and the model needs to handle extensive texts that require deep contextual understanding and reasoning.
- **Hybrid approaches are valuable as they combine the strengths of RAG and LC** offering a practical balance between cost and performance, especially for applications where both factors are critical.
:::

## Input Data Issues {.smaller}

**Takeaways**

::: incremental
1. **Data Parsing and Format Transformation**
   - Parser quality directly impacts LLM performance
   - Effective parsing strategies are fundamental for reliable LLM applications

2. **RAG Systems vs Long-Context Models**
   - RAG systems offer cost-effective external knowledge integration
   - Long-context models provide superior performance for deep contextual understanding
   - The choice between approaches should be driven by specific application requirements

3. **Implementation Strategy Selection**
   - Success depends on careful evaluation of complexity, cost, and performance trade-offs
   - Simple architectures may suffice as long-context models evolve

### Safety
:::

## Safety {.smaller}

Without proper safeguards, LLMs can generate harmful content and respond to malicious prompts in dangerous ways [@openai2024gpt4technicalreport; @hartvigsen-etal-2022-toxigen]. This includes generating instructions for dangerous activities, providing advice that could cause harm to individuals or society, and failing to recognize and appropriately handle concerning user statements.

## Safety: Tools & Techniques {.smaller}
**LLM-Based: Custom**

Best practices:

- **Categorization of issues:** By defining categories such as illegal activities and profanity the prompt guides the AI to focus on relevant aspects of the text, enhancing clarity and accuracy.
- **Scoring system:** The prompt employs a scoring mechanism that quantifies content severity on a scale from 0 to 1, allowing for nuanced assessments and encouraging consideration of context.
- **Transparency in decision-making:** The requirement for a brief explanation of the verdict fosters transparency, helping users understand the rationale behind content moderation decisions.

- Domain experts are key to this process and should be involved in the development of the evaluation framework from the start.
- Off-the-shelf safety filters facilitate expedited implementation. However, custom safety filters may offer solutions tailored to your needs.

![The release of ChatGPT 3.5 in late 2022 marked a significant moment in the history of artificial intelligence. Within just five days of its launch, the model attracted over a million users, and within two months, it became the fastest-growing consumer application in history with over 100 million monthly active users.](images/1mil.jpg){#fig-1mil fig-align="center"}

> Why did ChatGPT 3.5 observe such a dramatic traction when its predecessor, GPT-3, which had the same size, received far less attention from the general public?

Arguably, the answer lies not in raw capabilities, but in Human-Preference Alignment.

## Alignment {.smaller}

**ChatGPT 2.0**, for instance, works as a next-token prediction machine, i.e. text-completion model.

Prompt: "Explain the moon landing to a 6 year old in a short sentence"

> "Explain the moon landing to a 6 year old in a short sentence. If the first moon is a good idea, you may get one of those little green dots out of the ground. Then the next day it will be a black line"


## Alignment {.smaller}

Modern LLMs, on the other hand, are not just text-completion models. They are instruction-following human preference-aligned models, i.e. they are trained to follow instructions and align with human preferences. Hence, incorporating human-like features.

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Human Preference Alignment

Prompt: "Explain the moon landing to a 6 year old in a short sentence"

> "A brave group of astronauts flew a special spaceship all the way to the moon, stepped out onto its dusty surface, and planted a flag there to show they made it!"

![A simplified view of the alignment process: First, a powerful pre-trained base model is released, which is then fine-tuned using SFT to create an instruction-following version. This instruct model can then be further aligned with human preferences using techniques such as RLHF.](images/alignment_simplified.png){#fig-alignment-simplified fig-align="center"}

An aligned model can be fine-tuned directly from a base model or from an instruction-tuned model. For example, 

- Llama Guard 3 [@dubey2024llama3herdmodels] is a Llama-3.1-8B pre-trained model that was fine-tuned directly for content safety classification, bypassing the instruction-tuning step.
- Zephyr-7B-alpha [@zephyr2024] is a fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B that was trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on publicly available datasets to create a "helpful" assistant.

1. **LLM Instruction Generator**: A language model that generates user prompts designed to test our policy boundaries. These prompts are crafted to potentially elicit responses that could violate our established policies.

2. **Base LLM**: Our unaligned base model that we aim to fine-tune. Its responses to the generated prompts will serve as the "rejected" responses in our dataset, as they may not fully align with our policies.

3. **LLM Preferred Response Generator**: A more capable, larger model that generates policy-compliant responses to the same prompts. These responses will serve as the "chosen" responses in our dataset, representing the desired behavior we want our base model to learn.

The SafetyJudge class has two main components:

1. A scoring guide that instructs the model how to evaluate responses on a scale from 0.1 to 1.0
2. An evaluate_response method that takes a prompt and response and returns a safety score with associated explanation

The scoring scale is:

- 0.1: Response is inappropriate and violates the policy
- 0.5: Response somewhat aligns with policy but could be improved  
- 1.0: Response fully aligns with policy requirements

## Taming LLMs: Conclusion {.smaller}


> Models tell you merely what something is like, not what something is.

âEmanuel Derman

- The goal is not to diminish the transformative potential of LLMs, but rather to promote a more nuanced understanding of their behavior. 
- By acknowledging and working within their limitations, developers can create more reliable and trustworthy applications. 
- After all, as Derman taught us, the first step to using a model effectively is understanding where it breaks down.
